# [68. Text Justification](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/text-justification/)

## 题目

Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

- A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
- Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
- The input array `words` contains at least one word.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 300`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
- `words[i]` consists of only English letters and symbols.
- `1 <= maxWidth <= 100`
- `words[i].length <= maxWidth`

## 题目大意

给定一个字符串数组 words 和一个最大宽度 maxWidth，重新排版这个文本使得每一行恰有 maxWidth 个字符，而且是左右对齐的

你应该使用“贪心算法”来放置给定的单词；也就是说，尽可能多地往每行中放置单词。必要时可用空格 `' '` 填充，使得每行恰好有 *maxWidth* 个字符。

要求尽可能均匀分配单词间的空格数量。如果某一行单词间的空格不能均匀分配，则左侧放置的空格数要多于右侧的空格数。

文本的最后一行应为左对齐，且单词之间不插入额外的空格。

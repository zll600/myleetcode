# [714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 104`
- `0 <= fee < 5 * 104`

## 题目大意

给定一个整数数组 prices，其中第 i 个元素代表了第 i 天的股票价格 ；整数 fee 代表了交易股票的手续费用。

你可以无限次地完成交易，但是你每笔交易都需要付手续费。如果你已经购买了一个股票，在卖出它之前你就不能再继续购买股票了。

返回获得利润的最大值。

注意：这里的一笔交易指买入持有并卖出股票的整个过程，每笔交易你只需要为支付一次手续费
